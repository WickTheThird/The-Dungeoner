# PLAY button

# ABOUT ---- section displays the story of the nomad which i believe to be simple

#LEVELS will be a progress track

For the progress track we shall create a map that displays the charactoer over the level that they are 
We shall handle only 30 levels, in which we shall have a cool little linking between the levels --> I want to give it a seamless experience

# this shows all the levels due to be played
# and you can replay some of them, perhaps add a star system

# ISSUES

After remapping the events you may start drawing the pixel art for the buttons
We might also want to create our own background

We must also add a fullscreen version, this would only have an imact on the capera,
display positions and so on.
