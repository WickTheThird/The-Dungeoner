# Notes3

# add functional screens for each button

# PLAY button

# find the font perfect for the loading screen
# there is a liitle issue with the stone wall animatijon
# since we must repose the tabs after switching between the about and levels
# the about stone slows down

# ABOUT ---- section displays the story of the nomad which i believe to be simple
#you are a nomad of the dungeon warriors...your job is to simply find the top
#of the dungeon and see where the outside begins
# the quest won't be wasy as levels will get haarder and harder
#fighting dragons and other mobs

#LEVELS will be a progress track
# this shows all the levels due to be played
# and you can replay some of them, perhaps add a star system

#then the quit is a quit
