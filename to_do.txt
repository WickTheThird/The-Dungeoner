# Notes3

# add functional screens for each button

# PLAY button

# find the font perfect for the loading screen
# there is a liitle issue with the stone wall animatijon
# since we must repose the tabs after switching between the about and levels
# the about stone slows down

# ABOUT ---- section displays the story of the nomad which i believe to be simple

# in the about section, the events aren't mapped proprely
# we mus go throuh it again

#LEVELS will be a progress track

For the progress track we shall create a map that displays the charactoer over the level that they are 
We shall handle only 30 levels, in which we shall have a cool little linking between the levels --> I want to give it a seamless experience

# this shows all the levels due to be played
# and you can replay some of them, perhaps add a star system


# ISSUES TO FIX 

For now the extrascreen works, but the swiches aren't coordonated
In order to coordonate them we must go through the code again and remap the events

After remapping the events you may start drawing the pixel art for the buttons
We might also want to create our own background

We must also add a fullscreen version, this would only have an imact on the capera,
display positions and so on.
