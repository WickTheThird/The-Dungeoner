#Note that the following structure is to be followed in writing chest info
#We need to redo the model...make the item info be placed into one line (this might give you issues with indexing -- we'll cross that bridge when we get there...)


1. [id_of_item_in_chest]  # the default is 0 --> no item will ever be mapped to 0
2. [no_of_items] # the default is 1
3. [specific_location] # the default is 0
4. [position of the specific item in the chest]
